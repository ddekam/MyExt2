This is a file system built to behave like an Ext2.

1. run installEssentials as root (sudo)

2. execute make file and the simulated shell will launch

Developer Mode:
    By default it runs in developer mode. To change, go to make file and change the line
    that executes the program by removing the second parameter that says "developermode".
    This will no longer print all the optional information of the changes
    happening when running the program.

    EX: ./launchshell.elf disk developermode


*There is also a .pdf diagram to help visualize the Ext2 filesystem layout*
